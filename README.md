# Dis-Snek

This is `Dis-Snek`, an API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. This wrapper is designed to be easy to use, and easily modified to suit your needs. 

## "Is this just another discord.py fork"?

While this library shares some features or styles with discord.py, its completely separate from them. We think discord.py is a fantastic library, but we disagree with the direction and design decisions made by it.

## "Can I contribute to this project?"
Of course, you can contribute to this project by submitting a pull-request here. We also have a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/LVjnmYKt/dev-board) where you can see what we are working towards, feel free to do anything there.
