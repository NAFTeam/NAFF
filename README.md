# "What is this?"
This is `Dis-Snek`, an API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. This wrapper is designed to be easy to use, and easily modified to suit your needs.

#### Features: 
- ✅ 100% coverage of the application commands API 
- ✅ Modern and Pythonic API 
- ✅ Asynchronous operation
- ✅ Proper rate limit handling
- ✅ Dynamic cache with TTL support


## "Is this just another discord.py fork?"
While this library shares some features and stylistic choice with `discord.py`, its completely separate from them. We think `discord.py` is a fantastic library, but we disagree with the direction and design decisions made by it.

Compared to `discord.py`; `Snek` starts faster, responds faster, and is simpler to use. Especially compared to `Views`. 

## "I don't understand something"
If you need help with something, don’t hesitate to ask for help in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NTSHu97tHg)!
